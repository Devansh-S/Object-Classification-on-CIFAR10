# Object-Classification-on-CIFAR10

Python program for object detection. The program is capable of predicting 10 diffrent types of objects that include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.

# Dataset
The dataset used to train the model is CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The label classes in the dataset are:

    airplane 
    automobile 
    bird 
    cat 
    deer 
    dog 
    frog 
    horse 
    ship 
    truck

After training for 300 epochs on Google Colab, I was able to achieve 91.5% accuracy. For training for full 500 epochs more accurate results can be obtained.
